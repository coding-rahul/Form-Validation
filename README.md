# Form-Validation
The project is made with React in a Functional Programming like approach. 
Here I create json server that file pasted in User-Display repositories and I host json server locally in our system to stor the user data.
 Firstly go to json_form directory in Cmd.
 Then we need to start json server using Command line json-server --watch data.json --port 9864.
 Run npm to install packages (just a first time). Running the project go to project directory. 
 Run npm start(it runs the app in the development mode and opens http://localhost:3000 automatically to view in the browser).
